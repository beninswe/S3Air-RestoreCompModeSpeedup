# Enabling in Sonic 3 Air
Add the mod, and just select either Half Speedup or Full Speedup from the options menu, then go into competition mode, all levels will have the speedup by default.

## Original S3K Method for enabling
In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, you could perform the following (requires 2 controllers):
- Enable Level Select (by pressing Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Up, Up, Up on a vine in Angel Island 1)
- Enable Debug Mode (by pressing Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Up, Up, Up on a pulley in Mushroom Hill 1)
- The Sound Test is now like a speed dial, with 00 being no speedup, and FF being maximum speedup.
- Press Start on the selected speed.
- Enter competition mode.
- When starting a level Hold C+Start on the 2nd controller.
- The level will now be sped up.
